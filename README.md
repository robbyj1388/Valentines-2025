# Valentine's Day Heart and Flower Art with Music

This project was created to display a beautiful Valentine's Day-themed artwork using Python's `turtle` graphics and `pygame` for music playback. It features heart and flower drawings, along with a sweet message, and plays the song "My Cherie Amour" by Stevie Wonder to set a romantic mood.

## Features
- **Heart and Flower Drawing**: The program draws multiple heart shapes and a flower, all with dynamic colors and smooth animation.
- **Personalized Message**: Displays a personalized message such as "To: Jen <3" and "Happy Valentine's Day!" with a fun, colorful design.
- **Interactive Music**: Plays "My Cherie Amour" by Stevie Wonder on loop in the background to enhance the atmosphere.
- **Dynamic Colors**: Uses alternating colors to make the artwork lively and vibrant.
- **Random Movement**: Hearts are drawn in random positions to add variation to the display.

## Libraries Used
